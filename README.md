# SPI-Slave-with-SRAM
SPI Slave With Single Port Memory
# Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication protocol. The project includes the design and code for an SPI Slave, a single-port synchronous RAM, and an SPI Wrapper that connects the RAM and SPI Slave.
# SPI Communication Protocol
SPI is a synchronous serial communication protocol used for short-distance communication, primarily in embedded systems. It enables a master device to communicate with one or more slave devices at high speeds using a minimal number of I/O pins. The protocol uses four main signals:

MOSI (Master Out Slave In): Carries data from the master to the slave.
MISO (Master In Slave Out): Carries data from the slave to the master.
SCLK (Serial Clock): Clock signal generated by the master to synchronize data transmission.
SS/CS (Slave Select/Chip Select): Used by the master to select which slave to communicate with.
